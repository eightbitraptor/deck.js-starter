Deck.js Boilerplate
===================

TODO:

- Upload to GH
- GH pages.
- Slide: GH Pages, Repo
- Custom CSS (links, etc.)
- NPM: build, watch targets (and make work!).

[Deck.js] is a fantastic HTML-based approach to presentations. This is some
basic boilerplate code for my talks, including the following tweaks and
plugins:

* CodeMirror:
* Jade: "index.jade" can be built to "index.html", or you can edit "index.html"
  directly without building.
